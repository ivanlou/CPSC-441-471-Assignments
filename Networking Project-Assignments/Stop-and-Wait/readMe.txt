Here is an implementation of Stop and Wait protocol.
A jar file for a server (for testing) and some extra source code for additional classes used in the implementation


I wrote the source code implementation for the client. 

Credit and Information for the original creator(s) of the server JAR files used for testing and the source code for the FtpSegment class are included in the README.txt files included with said files or within the source code files themselves
