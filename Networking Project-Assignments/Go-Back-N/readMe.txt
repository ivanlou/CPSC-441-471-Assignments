An implementation of the Go-Back-N (GBN) transfer protocol.
Test server jar file and additional source code included.
Some flaws with the source code implementation:
-File transfer works properly, but depending on the input to the server and source code, the program may not terminate when finished or the program gets stuck in a loop with TimerTask's

I wrote the source code implementation for the GBN protocol. 

Credit and Information for the original creator(s) of the server JAR files used for testing and the source code for the FtpSegment class are included in the README.txt files included with said files or within the source code files themselves
